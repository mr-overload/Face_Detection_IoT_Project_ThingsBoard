# Face_Detection_IoT_Project_ThingsBoard
This is an IoT project to count number of faces detected in an Image and storing the information to ThingsBoard

An explanation of the code is in code itself.

I have used python 3.6 and opencv 3.1.0.1
version below 4.0.0 is recommended for opencv

libraries to install
----opencv-python
----paho.mqtt

A GUI based software will come soon.
